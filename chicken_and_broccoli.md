* 1 Tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch

### Sauce
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) light soy sauce 
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) mirin (or 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine + 1/2 tablespoon sugar)

### Cornstarch Slurry:
2 teaspoons (6g) cornstarch
1 tablespoon (15ml) cold water

### Other
* 12-16 oz broccoli, cut into pieces, including stems
* Other vegetables as desired
* 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2" segment of ginger. minced

## Method
1. Mix sliced chicken with soy sauce and cornstarch, massage in then set aside for ~15 minutes
2. Combine soy sauce, wine, vinegar, oyster sauce, and chicken stock or water in a small bowl and stir together until homogenous. Set aside. 
3. Combine cornstarch and cold water in a separate small bowl and stir with a fork until cornstarch is dissolved. Set aside.
4. Heat a couple cups of salted water in a wok over high heat until boiling. Add broccoli, cover, and cook until tender-crisp, about 1 minute. Drain and transfer to a plate to air-dry.
5. Heat wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and swirl to coat. Add half of the chicken, spread into a single layer and let it cook until lightly seared, about 30 seconds. Repeat with second half of chicken.
6. Stir-fry until chicken is mostly cooked through and only a few pink spots remain. Immediately add garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds longer.
7. Add 1 tablespoon mirin wine by pouring it around the side of the wok. Stir sauce mixture and pour it in around the sides of the wok. Toss to combine.
8. Add broccoli and toss to combine. Stir the cornstarch slurry and add a splash. Cook, tossing, until sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked through, about 30 seconds longer. Adjust sauce thickness with cornstarch slurry if needed.
