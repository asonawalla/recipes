Originally derived from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYxB4QBlrx4)

## Ingredients

* 160g all purpose flour
* 112g water (70%)
* 1/4tsp yeast
* 1/2tsp salt
* splash (~1tsp) extra virgin olive oil
* shredded mozzarella and cheddar or other hard cheese (about 3/4 moz, 1/4 cheddar)
* small amount of tomato sauce
* other toppings as desired

## Procedure

* Add the flour, water, and yeast in the mixer and knead
* Add salt and a splash of olive oil as the dough comes together. Will be very wet.
* Let rise at least 2, ideally 5 hours covered in the mixer bowl
* Oil a cast iron pan and turn dough into it. With wet fingers, start spreading dough evenly out in pan. Will probably spring back a little.
* After 15 minutes covered (enough time to prep toppings), spread again, this time should make it all the way to the edges. Start preheating oven to 400F.
* After another 15 minutes, top pizza with:
  * a pinch of salt directly on the slightly risen dough
  * cheese on bottom, spread all the way up to edges to get the cheese crown
  * dollops of tomato sauce. avoid getting it too wet.
  * any other toppings
* bake at 400F for 25 minutes
* cut and eat immediately or cool on wire rack
