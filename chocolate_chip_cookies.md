# Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup (1 stick) butter, melted
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks
- 4 oz dark chocolate chunks (or your preferred mix) ([Reddit][1])

## Instructions

1. **Make the sugar-butter paste:** In a large bowl, whisk together both sugars, the salt, and the melted butter until you have a smooth, lump-free paste.
2. **Add egg & vanilla:** Whisk in the egg and vanilla extract until the mixture lightens and you see "ribbons" falling off the whisk.
3. **Incorporate dry ingredients:** Sift in the flour and baking soda, then gently fold with a spatula—mix just until combined to avoid tough cookies.
4. **Stir in chocolate:** Fold in all the chocolate chunks evenly through the dough.
5. **Chill:** Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight for deeper flavor and color).
6. **Preheat oven:** Heat to 350 °F (180 °C).
7. **Portion & bake:** Using an ice-cream scoop or tablespoon, place dough balls 4 inches apart on a parchment-lined sheet. Bake 10 minutes, until edges are just turning golden.
8. **Cool & serve:** Let cookies cool completely on the pan so they set up perfectly. Enjoy! ([Reddit][1])

Feel free to experiment with chilling times or chocolate proportions to tailor chewiness and sweetness to your taste. Happy baking!
