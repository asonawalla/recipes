# Gooey Chocolate Chunk Cookies

### Ingredients:

* **2 ½ cups** all-purpose flour
* **1 teaspoon** baking soda
* **1 teaspoon** cornstarch (keeps cookies soft)
* **½ teaspoon** table salt
* **1 cup (2 sticks)** unsalted butter, softened
* **¾ cup** packed light brown sugar
* **½ cup** granulated sugar
* **2 large eggs**, room temperature
* **2 teaspoons** pure vanilla extract
* **2 cups** semi-sweet or dark chocolate chunks
* **Flaky sea salt**, for sprinkling

### Instructions:

1. **Prep:**
   Preheat your oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Dry Ingredients:**
   In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and table salt. Set aside.

3. **Wet Ingredients (Stand Mixer):**
   In your stand mixer bowl with the paddle attachment, cream softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium speed until fluffy and creamy (2-3 minutes).

4. **Eggs & Vanilla:**
   Add eggs one at a time, mixing until combined after each. Mix in vanilla extract.

5. **Combine:**
   With the mixer on low, gradually add dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Avoid over-mixing. Fold in chocolate chunks by hand or briefly on low speed.

6. **Scoop Dough:**
   Using an ice cream scoop or spoon, form dough balls (about 2–3 tablespoons each). Place dough balls on the baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart.

7. **Bake:**
   Bake for **10-12 minutes**, until edges are golden but centers look slightly underbaked (this ensures gooeyness).

8. **Sea Salt Finish:**
   Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle each cookie lightly with flaky sea salt.

9. **Cool:**
   Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes (they'll set a bit) before transferring to a cooling rack.

### To Freeze Dough:

* Form dough balls as above.
* Place them on a parchment-lined sheet pan, freeze until solid (\~2 hours), then transfer into a zip-top bag.
* Bake directly from frozen, adding about 1–2 extra minutes to baking time.

Enjoy your gooey, delicious chocolate chunk cookies!
