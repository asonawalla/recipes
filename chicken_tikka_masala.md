# Chicken Tikka Masala

This is a loose recipe based on various videos, articles, and experimentation. The main ingredients are boneless yogurt-marinated
chicken in a smooth tomato, cream, and coriander sauce, but some extra effort goes a long way.  I'll try to mark the optional
stuff here, but in a lot of cases it's a typical case of "use what you have".

## Prep

### Marinade

Taste the marinade before adding chicken, it should balance salt, acid, and heat.  Amounts are eyeball estimates but will change
based on the amount of chicken.  Typically go for 2 large chicken breasts.

- 2 heaping tablespoons of yogurt (enough to coat the chicken)
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

### Spice Mix

The lazy spice mix is 1/2/4 parts turmeric/chili powder/garam masala assuming relatively fresh spices (the idea is that the garam
masala should bring the coriander). It's worth the time to augment this base with whole spices ground in a mortar and pestle.

- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp garam masala

Mortar and pestle:
- 1 heaping tsp coriander seeds
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- (optional) 1/2 tsp mustard seed
- (optional) 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorn
- (optional) 2-3 cloves
- (optional) ~1 inch cinnamon

Extra (for simmering):
- Bay leaf
- Star anise
- Cinnamon stick

### Sauce

Canned tomatoes and coconut milk work well enough for this recipe.  We've tried cream + water instead of coconut milk, though that
seems to separate more easily (especially as leftovers).

- 1 inch ginger (finely mince or paste)
- 3-4 cloves garlic (finely mince or paste)
- 1 large red onion, finely diced
- 1 28oz can tomatoes
- 1 healthy tube squeeze tomato paste
- 1 14oz can coconut milk
- Handful of chopped cilantro (coriander leaf)

## Cook

- Char the chicken, ideally under a broiler.  Foil-lined baking sheet keeps the mess down from the yogurt.  Doesn't need to be cooked through.  Set aside when done.
- In a dutch oven or similar over medium heat, heat neutral oil and sweat onions with salt until the moisture is driven out.
- Add spice mix, ginger & garlic, and tomato paste.  Let bloom.
- Add tomatoes and coconut milk, scrape the bottom to de-glaze.
- Once everything is softened, take off heat and immersion blend until very smooth.
- Stir and bring to a simmer.
- Add bay leaf, star anise, cinnamon stick.
- Simmer on lowest setting for 30 mins covered.
- Halfway in, add chicken.
- Stir in chopped cilantro before serving.
