## Ingredients
* 3 cups (spooned & leveled) AP Flour (400g)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/3 cup (2.67 oz) neutral oil (canola or similar)
* 1 cup warm water

## Instructions
1. Mix dry ingredients in mixer bowl
2. Add wet ingredients, stir until combined
3. Knead 1-2 minutes with dough hook
4. Divide into tortilla portions and form into balls. 16 pieces (42g each) for large burrito tortillas, 32 pieces (21g each) for small taco tortillas
5. Cover dough balls and let rest 15-30 min
6. Heat skillet to med-high
7. Roll each dough ball out thin; should be translucent when rolled out fully
8. Cook tortilla 1 min on first side; as bubbles form press them down gently with a spatula to get them to spread out into one big bubble. This is what makes them flaky
9. Flip, cook 15-20 seconds more, just enough to brown
10. Stack cooked tortillas and keep them wrapped in a dry towel to stay warm
