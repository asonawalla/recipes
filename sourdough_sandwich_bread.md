Wet Ingredients

* 80g water, warm (95-105 F)

Procedure

* Feed starter ~12h before mixing dough
* Kitchen aid all the ingredients, knead 5-10 minutes in Kitchen aid
* 2-4 hour rise on counter, or fridge overnight
* Greased loaf plan, rolled dough
* ~4 hour second rise (preheat oven when bread is just below lid of pullman pan, about doubled)
* Bake at 350 for 35 minutes (for pullman pans, 25 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered)

Note: Rise is more important than time. This recipe performs much better if not rushed.
